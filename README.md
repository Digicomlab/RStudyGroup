## Study Group Schedule

This study group is designed to teach basic R programming and using the tidyverse package for data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization. Below I have listed the video tutorial (please watch it before coming to the session) and optional reading materials if you are interested. The readings are taken from [R for Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), an open access book.
